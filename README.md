# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. Based on this fact, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been developed, which is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. As such, in this python project I have tried building a model which will be able to recognize emotion from sound files.
